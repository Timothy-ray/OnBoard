# YOUR PROJECT NAME

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
i was using an arduino pro mini and a mpu-6050 breakout board for a flight stabaliser for a rc plane. wanted to convert it to a pcb to save weight. 
the pcb also includes a bmp-280 pressure sencor. this board will take the data from the two sencors and direct to servos to stabalise a light weight glider along its path


<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
this project will cost $3.17 for the pcb. about $22.4 for componants. and roughly $14 for the stencil
jlcpcb estimate at $55 if i dont use the pick-place-assembly service jlcpcb provied.


<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

i have done sever arduino projects but have never tried converting them to a pcb. i first got inspired to convert my project onto a pcb after seeing a jlcpcb add in a you tube video.
i spent 2 months looking at schematics and reading pdf on serical conmunication, pull up resistors, fillering capacitors and many other topics. youtube was a major help.
major challange was filtering out confliction infomation from forums or websites.
